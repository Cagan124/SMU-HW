For this UnSupervised learning assignment, I referred to past class activities in week 19. Instead of immediately adding the graphs in hvplot, I first created then in matplotlib to give a more clear and concise view. I added the plots in hvplot below the originals. To help with the Composing Plot at the end of the assignment, I referred to https://holoviz.org/tutorial/Composing_Plots.html.
