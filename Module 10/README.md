For this challenge, I created raw SQL and ORM queries analyzing the climate data provided in the Resources folder. With the experienced I have gained in this class prior to this challenge, I was most comfortable creating the raw SQL queries however, after this challenge I feel as if I have a strong understanding for ORM queries. A note is included in the code separating the two different queury types.
