For this challenge, I created raw SQL and ORM queries analyzing the climate data provided in the Resources folder. With the experienced I have gained in this class prior to this challenge, I was most comfortable creating the raw SQL queries however, after this challenge I feel as if I have a strong understanding for ORM queries. A note is included in the code separating the two different query types. 

I also created an App with Flask to show the queries that were created in the notebook. I took 3 of the queries from my notebook and had to create two new queries based on the requirements for the assignment. I used in-class assignments to help with the outline of the flask App. The assignments referenced were "Week 10, day 3, activities 9 & 10". This helped create a clean and concise outline to show the queries. For the sake of all queries being in the same format, I chose to use the raw SQL queries rather than the ORM queries.
